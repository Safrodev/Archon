In order to summon, you will need to find $(l:archon:necromancy/soul_tomes)Soul Tomes$() throughout the world and bind them to your staff in a crafting table. As you pick up $(l:archon:necromancy/souls)souls$(), your staff will gain soul power to make summons stronger. Note: your summons are bound only to your staff, not you."

You can cycle between owned summons with sneak + right-click, just like with wands. Summons will have more lifetime, health, damage, and speed as you increase your soul power."
